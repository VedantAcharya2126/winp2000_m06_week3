# Learning About Linux.

## Introduction: 
> - Linux is the most common operting system all around the world. It was first created for personal computers using intel x86 architecture. It has been ported to more platforms compare to any other operating system.

> - There are many linux distributions developed by  communities for business purpose. such as Debian, Ubuntu, Kali Linux. Lubuntu and Xubuntu are two of the many different distribution and customized that are included in the ubuntu itself. Discuss more about the Linux Operating System further in this lab.


## Section 1: Linux History
**1. Write about the origins and history of Linux.**
> - Linux originated in 1991 when Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, created a free, open-source operating system. He is not satisfy with the existing systems like MS-DOS and MINIX, he built his own kernel and shared it online. Developers quickly joined, combining Torvalds' kernel with tools from the GNU Project, resulting in a full, Unix-like operating system. Released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), Linux encouraged global collaboration, leading to widespread use in servers, smartphones, and supercomputers. Today, Linux is a cornerstone of modern computing and open-source development.

**2. Mention the key contributors (e.g., Linus Torvalds) and the development of the Linux kernel.**
> - The GNU Project, led by Richard Stallman, provided essential tools and software that, when combined with Torvalds’ kernel, completed the Linux operating system.

> - Over the years, many key contributors helped shape Linux. Alan Cox became one of the earliest and most influential developers, maintaining the kernel for years, while David Miller expanded Linux’s compatibility with various hardware architectures. Companies like Red Hat, IBM, and Google further fueled its development, with Linux now powering everything from servers and smartphones to supercomputers, making it a cornerstone of modern computing.

**3. Explain how Linux has evolved and its significance in modern computing.**
> - The evolution of **Linux Operating System** has been dramatically influenced by its adoption in enterprise enviornments. Because of Scalability, reliability and security, the demand of using linux as server, cloud computing, embedded systems would be the best choice. The relation between open-source and commercial entities has drivethe kernel's development, ensuring it meets the demands of mordern computing

## Section 2: Linux Distributions:
**1. Explain what Linux distributions are and why they are important.**
> - The linux operating system made from the group of software that includes the linux kernal and often, a package management system. Users of linux can download one of the linux distribution, which ar available for powerfull super computers to embedded devices and personal computers.

> - **Importance of Linux Distributions:**
>  1. It is open source, so anybody can to contribute, edit, and improve the source code.
> 2. It is more secure comapate to windows operatinf systems, Admin access is required in order to authorize each program in the application.
>  3. Linux offer quick and easy way to update than windows.
>  4. Installation process is much easier and quicker than windows and other operating system because it involves less user input.


**2. Provide examples of popular Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch Linux, etc**
> - **Some of the most common Linux Distributions are**:
> **1. Ubuntu:** It is a free open source linux distribution that comes with three various flavors Desktop, Server, and core of IT.
> **2. Debian:** It is a stable linux distribution. but time to upgrade debain is too long. Its is possible that your are using the same version for long time.
> **3. Kali Linux:** Kali Linux is the best distribution for ethical hacking objectives

**3. Describe the differences between various distributions.**
> Here is the difference between 3 different distributions

| Based on | Kali Linux  | Ubuntu | Debian |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Kernel | Customized Kali Linux kernel	 | Ubuntu Kernel | Debian Kernal  |
| Release cycle | Rolling release | Two releases per year, LTS releases once in two years |  Regular stable, testing, and unstable branches (fixed released cycle) |
| Use cases | testing and malware analysis | General purpose | General Purpose  |
| Default shell | ZSH | Bash |  bash |
| Initial release | March 13, 2013 | October 20, 2004 | August 16, 1993  |
| ARM support | Yes | NO. Only Server edition | yes  |
| Default terminal app | qterminal | GNOME terminal | GNOME terminal  |

## Section 3: Basic Linux Commands: 
**1. List and explain some common Linux commands.**
| command | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ls | Use to list the content of current directory |
| pwd | Print the current directory path |
| cd | Refers to change directory |
| rm | Use to remove files and directories |
| mv | Command to move or rename files and directories |
| mkdir | Use too create folder  |
| man | It displays the manual page of any other command  |
| touch | Command allows you to update the access and modification times of the specified files |
| chmod | command lets you change the Permissions of a file.|
| exit | Use to end the seesion of shell or close the terminal |
| sudo | This command stands for **superuser do**, and it lets you act as a superuser or root user while you’re running a specific command |

## Conclusion:
> - Linux waqs first created by linus Torvalds an original kernal operating system in 1991 powering diverse enviroments. Because of its open source nature fosters a wide range of distributions, such as Ubuntu for general purpose usage, Debian for the stability, and kali Linux for security testimg. This variety allows users to select systems according to their needs, while shared features like security, performance,  and customization make Linux a popular choice accross industries. 

> - As Linux continues to adapt, its significance in cloud computing, embedded systems, and everyday use remains strong, with command-line tools offering flexibility and control for users at all levels.
